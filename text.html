    some of the tags are for actual text elements and some are inline, meaning you apply them inside of text elements. the following text element has an inline italic applied -->
    <p>this paragraph text has <em>italic text</em> as inline formatting.</p>

    <p class="class">
      this paragraph text has a class of "class" applied so the css rule .class
      will affect it. you can have many elements with .class applied
    </p>

    <p id="id" class="class">
      this paragraph text has a class of "class" applied so the css rule .class
      will affect it. you can have many elements with .class applied. it also
      has an id of "id" applied. you only get to use each id once in a page.
      note the id overwrites the rule for the class.
    </p>

    <p class="class2 class">
      this paragraph text has both classes of "class" and "class2" applied. it
      is red because "class2" is listed last in the css list and so it
      overwrites what values were defined before.
    </p>

    <p>this paragraph text has <span class="class2">a span with "class2" applied</span> as inline formatting.</p>
